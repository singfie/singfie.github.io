excerpt: 'As e-commerce and urban deliveries spike, cities grapple with managing urban freight more actively. To manage urban deliv- eries effectively, city planners and policy makers need to better understand driver behaviors and the challenges they experi- ence in making deliveries. In this study, we collected data on commercial vehicle (CV) driver behaviors by performing ridealongs with various logistics carriers. Ridealongs were performed in Seattle, Washington, covering a range of vehicles (cars, vans, and trucks), goods (parcels, mail, beverages, and printed materials), and customer types (residential, office, large and small retail). Observers collected qualitative observations and quantitative data on trip and dwell times, while also track- ing vehicles with global positioning system devices. The results showed that, on average, urban CVs spent 80% of their daily operating time parked. The study also found that, unlike the common belief, drivers (especially those operating heavier vehi- cles) parked in authorized parking locations, with only less than 5% of stops occurring in the travel lane. Dwell times associ- ated with authorized parking locations were significantly longer than those of other parking locations, and mail and heavy goods deliveries generally had longer dwell times. We also identified three main criteria CV drivers used for choosing a park- ing location: avoiding unsafe maneuvers, minimizing conflicts with other users of the road, and competition with other com- mercial drivers. The results provide estimates for trip times, dwell times, and parking choice types, as well as insights into why those decisions are made and the factors affecting driver choices.'
