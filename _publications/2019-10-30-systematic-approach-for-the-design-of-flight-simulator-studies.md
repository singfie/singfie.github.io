excerpt: 'The examination of commercial pilot workload often requires the use of controlled simulated studies to identify causal effects. The specific scenarios to consider within a simulator study require an extensive understanding of the safety situations that can occur in flight while also considering the specific training that pilots are provided within a simulated environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide a more systematic approach to scenario identification based on historical data, feasibility of capturing behavioral changes, simulator constraints, and training curricula.'
