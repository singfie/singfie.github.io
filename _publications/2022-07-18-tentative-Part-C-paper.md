excerpt: 'This paper explores the value of information on parking availability in urban environments for commercial vehicle deliveries. The research investigates how historic cruising and parking delay data can be leveraged to improve the routes of carriers in urban environments to increase cost efficiency. To do so, the paper develops a methodology consisting of a travel time prediction model and a routing model, which account for parking delay estimates. The method is applied to both a real-world case study to show immediate application potential as well as a synthetic data set to identify environments and route characteristics which benefit the most from considering this information. Results on the real-world data set show a mean total drive time savings of 1.5\%. The synthetic data set shows potential mean total drive time saving of 21.6\% with routes with fewer stops, homogeneous spatial distribution, and high cruising time standard deviation showing the largest savings potential at up to 62.3\%. The results demonstrate that higher visibility on curb activity for commercial vehicles can reduce time per vehicle spent in urban environments and with that decrease the impact on congestion and space use in cities.'
