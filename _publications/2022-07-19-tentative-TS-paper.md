excerpt: 'During responses to evacuation notices, emergency managers and coordinators need to make decisions on resource allocation quickly. Frequently, information about the location and exact numbers of evacuees is incomplete or uncertain. This is especially relevant for evacuations that require the coordination of evacuation resources that are specifically for isolated areas. While the recently introduced Isolated Community Evacuation Problem (ICEP) has provided a tool to plan the evacuation for isolated areas, it relies on accuracy of the demand numbers and distribution to provide a high quality solution. The models presented in this paper provide solutions to this problem through two alternative approaches to handle uncertainty during emergency response. The proposed robust optimization (R-ICEP) and rolling-horizon optimization (RH-ICEP) variants of the ICEP, provide methods that optimize evacuation routes considering uncertainty sets and evolving information on demand numbers respectively. Computational results demonstrate that the rolling-horizon method consistently outperforms the deterministic baseline model, while the robust method outperforms only for certain problem structures, and to a lesser degree than the rolling-horizon method. Taking advantage of evolving information through the RH-ICEP is therefore the most reliable method for emergency response involving uncertainty and can help emergency coordinators to respond more efficiently to isolated community evacuation.'
