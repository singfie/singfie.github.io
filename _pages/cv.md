Work experience
======
* Pre-Doctoral Research Associate @[University of Washington -- Supply Chain Transportation & Logistics Center](https://depts.washington.edu/sctlctr/)
  * June 2019 - Ongoing
  * Accomplishments:
    * Led collaboration with Municipality of Bowen Island in Canada and coordinated team of 2 people to develop evacuation plan. 
    * Slashed estimated evacuation time of isolated communities by 70% through mixed-integer stochastic optimization model, solved through meta-heuristics. 
    * Reduced route time for commercial trucks by 7% through combined OD-matrix estimation and route optimization framework that incorporates expected parking delays into vehicle routing. 
    * Developed demand-driven mixed integer model to optimize the location of commercial vehicle loading zones in urban areas.

* Research Scientist Intern 2 @[Amazon](https://www.amazon.science)
  * June 2021 - September 2021
  * Accomplishments:
    * Improved expected resource planning cost for trucks by approx. 15% through routing-based resource optimization model using robust optimization and column-generation decomposition techniques in nationwide logistic network. 
    * Reduced manual adjustments in resource planning process by approx. 60% through flexible block-based resource planning tool.

* Research Scientist Intern 1 @[Amazon](https://www.amazon.science) 
  * June 2020 - September 2020
  * Accomplishments:
    * Saved $26M in fixed costs per year in North American middle mile logistics network through combined planning and routing of multiple value streams with a shared equipment fleet. 
    * Reduced analysis time for equipment rightsizing and combined routing simulation from approx. 3 months to 12 hours of analysis time by leveraging big data warehousing, parallel computing and data pipeline integration.

* Research Assistant @[University of Washington -- Dep. of Industrial Engineering](https://ise.washington.edu) 
  * Sep 2018 - Jun 2019
  * Accomplishments:
    * Designed experiment, simulator set up, data collection, and analysis for a pilot workload study with flight simulator and developed systematic method for scenario selection. 
    * Developed a simulation model for investigating the effect of urban traffic density-based vehicle guidance systems on traffic flow.

* Material Planner Intern @[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) 
  * Jun 2018 - Sep 2018
  * Accomplishments:

    * Streamlined cross-functional processes for improved material and information flow between three business units.

* Supply Chain Improvement Manager @[Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en)
  * Oct 2016 - Sep 2017
  * Accomplishments:
    * Reduced inventory capital tie-up by $100M through data-driven target-setting process for optimized inventory levels. 
    * Collaborated with Business Transformation Director on 5 year road map for improved supply chain function, and managed the resulting project portfolio.

* Co-op Rotational Internship Program @[Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en)
  * Aug 2013 - Oct 2016
  * Accomplishments:
    * Completed project-based engineering internships in engineering, production, supply chain, and quality departments.
