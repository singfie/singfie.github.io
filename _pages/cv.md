[Resume](https://singfie.github.io/files/2021_10_20_krutein_resume.pdf)

Education
======
* B.S. in Industrial Engineering & Business Management (Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen), FH Nordakademie Hochschule der Wirtschaft (University of Applied Sciences), Germany, 2017
* Certificate of Proficiency in Industrial Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand, 2015
* M.S. in Industrial Engineering, University of Washington, USA, 2019
* Ph.D in Industrial Engineering, University of Washington, USA, 2022 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Pre-Doctoral Research Associate @University of Washington -- Supply Chain Transportation & Logistics Center (June 2019 - Ongoing)
  * Led collaboration with Municipality of Bowen Island in Canada and coordinated team of 2 people to develop evacuation plan. 
  * Slashed estimated evacuation time of isolated communities by 70% through mixed-integer stochastic optimization model, solved through meta-heuristics. 
  * Reduced route time for commercial trucks by 7% through combined OD-matrix estimation and route optimization framework that incorporates expected parking delays into vehicle routing. 
  * Developed demand-driven mixed integer model to optimize the location of commercial vehicle loading zones in urban areas.

* Research Scientist Intern 2 @Amazon (June 2021 - September 2021)
  * Improved expected resource planning cost for trucks by approx. 15% through routing-based resource optimization model using robust optimization and column-generation decomposition techniques in nationwide logistic network. 
  * Reduced manual adjustments in resource planning process by approx. 60% through flexible block-based resource planning tool.

* Research Scientist Intern 1 @Amazon (June 2020 - September 2020)
  * Saved $26M in fixed costs per year in North American middle mile logistics network through combined planning and routing of multiple value streams with a shared equipment fleet. 
  * Reduced analysis time for equipment rightsizing and combined routing simulation from approx. 3 months to 12 hours of analysis time by leveraging big data warehousing, parallel computing and data pipeline integration.

* Research Assistant @University of Washington -- Dep. of Industrial Engineering (Sep 2018 - Jun 2019)
  * Designed experiment, simulator set up, data collection, and analysis for a pilot workload study with flight simulator and developed systematic method for scenario selection. 
  * Developed a simulation model for investigating the effect of urban traffic density-based vehicle guidance systems on traffic flow.

* Material Planner Intern @Tesla (Jun 2018 - Sep 2018)
  * Reduced number of missing parts in warehouse by 10% through statistical data analysis and machine learning model to identify causes of missing parts and predict inventory shortage. 
  * Streamlined cross-functional processes for improved material and information flow between three business units.

* Supply Chain Improvement Manager @Airbus (Oct 2016 - Sep 2017)
  * Reduced inventory capital tie-up by $100M through data-driven target-setting process for optimized inventory levels. 
  * Collaborated with Business Transformation Director on 5 year road map for improved supply chain function, and managed the resulting project portfolio.

* Co-op Rotational Internship Program @Airbus (Aug 2013 - Oct 2016)
  * Completed project-based engineering internships in engineering, production, supply chain, and quality departments.
