The research presented in this paper provides an approximate solution method to the recently introduced Isolated Community Evacuation Problem (ICEP). The ICEP is a routing model formulation that allows to optimize the planning and response to evacuation events of isolated communities, such as islands and mountain valleys that are not accessible by road and have to be evacuated by a set of recovery resources. Due to its routing structure, the ICEP is NP-complete and therefore the computational time does not scale well for large problem sizes. The urgent need of evacuation coordination decisions during an emergency requires evacuation models to be solved within a reasonable time frame. Therefore, this paper investigates solving this problem using a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm from the meta-heuristic domain to solve this problem. The paper presents a new decoder method specific to the ICEP, that allows to translate in between an instance of the S-ICEP and the BRKGA. The benefits of this method are that it allows to find the global optimum in expectation and is suitable for parallel processing. The method is validated through computational results that show the validity of the approach.
